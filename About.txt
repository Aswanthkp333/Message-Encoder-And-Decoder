

This is a Python script that creates a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) application for text encryption and decryption
using the tkinter module. The application uses a secret key (password) to encrypt and decrypt the text using
base64 encoding.

The main_screen() function creates the main window of the application and sets up the GUI elements,
such as text input and buttons for encryption, decryption, and reset.

The encrypt() and decrypt() functions are called when the corresponding buttons are clicked. 
They first check if the password entered matches the correct password ("1234"), and if not,
display an error message. If the password is correct, the function encodes or decodes the text using base64 and displays the result in a new window.

The reset() function is called when the reset button is clicked, and it clears the input fields.

Overall, this is a simple script for a basic text encryption and decryption application
using a password and base64 encoding.
